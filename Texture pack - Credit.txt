Though I have been assembling this pack for the sole purpose 
of the Betaworld citizens' enjoyment, this pack is not all my 
own personal work.


The base pack was brilliantly created by Misa! Below is the 
direct link to the page.

If you want the full effect of ctm and mcpatcher textures 
(and I know you do!!) please visit her site and get the full 
pack!  For more instructions, feel free to PM me!


I have just got permission to use the wonderful KoP Photo Realism 
pack from xx12xx!  I will be making the transition from Misa to 
KoP as time allows!

Seriously, go check out his work, it is very impressive!
