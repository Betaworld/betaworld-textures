Seriously, with a Resource Pack like this, it would be retarded not to have a changelog. 

I started the base pack the day Betaworld's first rc modpack started. This base pack was completed March of 2014. 

The base pack contains a huge chunk of textures I considered to be essential. It makes no sense to make and animate a tool that it takes months to gather, but not have the basic items it takes to make it.

Mod packs in the "done" state;
(please note:"done" doesn't mean every texture is updated.  It means that the pack is at anywhere from 80-100% complete. Textures can still be changed upon community feedback)
