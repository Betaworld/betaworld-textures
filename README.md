betaworld-textures
==================

Official Betaworld texture pack.

--------------------------------------------------------------

The base pack was brilliantly created by Misa! Below is the 
direct link to the page.

If you want the full effect of ctm and mcpatcher textures 
(and I know you do!!) please visit her site and get the full 
pack!  For more instructions, feel free to PM me!

I have just got permission to use the wonderful KoP Photo Realism 
pack from xx12xx!  I will be making the transition from Misa to 
KoP as time allows!
